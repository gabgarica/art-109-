                <h2> To you,</h2>
                <p> In about 50-100 years I believe that the future of the internet will look different than it does today. This first prediction is made on the premise that the internet does not uphold the same aesthetics of its initial launch. As you may know, it took a rather short period of time for the internet to transform its looks and functions, and as a result it developed along the way to function more uniquely, personally, and differently than then. Plainly to say the internet you logged into about ten years ago does not fully look the same as it does today. So on good authority one can believe the future internet will look and function differently than it does today 
 I admit I’m not the strongest theorist, despite this, I predict the internet will still host the same remnants of today’s internet. You would still be able to make a quick internet search, use websites, make transactions, but the design of the internet would have changed or evolved with the inclusion of new emergent spaces on the web. In other words, I predict there will be new features that change the way we both visually look at our screens and interact with them when we access the web. I apologize, for the most part my predictions have been pretty general, however one thing is for certain: the internet will change and expand its capabilities.
It will continue to expand its use of AI and therefore become widespread. If the internet is still running by then AI will be so fully ingrained that we’ll forget how the internet used to work prior to its introduction. We’d be able to speak directly into an AI chat-bot, our computer parts would be made with AI in them, and AI would know who you are and your tendencies.
