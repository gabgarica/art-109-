             <p> In about fifty to a hundred years, I believe that the future of the internet will look different than it does today. This first prediction is made on the premise that the internet does not uphold the same aesthetics of its initial launch and creation. As you might recall, it took a rather short period of time for the internet to transform its looks; and as a result of this, the internet has developed along the way to function more uniquely, personally, and faster than then. Plainly speaking, the internet you logged into about twenty-five years ago does not resemble the exact aesthetics and functions of that time; it has grown and been updated to feature improved graphics and features. Thus, on good authority, one can believe the future internet will look and function differently than it does today, especially in the next fifty to a hundred years to come. I expect it to develop in unprecedented ways that aren’t parallel to today. I’m visualizing rapid responsiveness, tightly secured networks, super personalized algorithms or systems, and areas for connecting with people like never seen before. Much of what I’m listing we already do see on the web today, however, it’s going to get a lot stronger, faster, and immersive. 
             </p>

             <p> I admit I’m not the strongest theorist. Despite this, I predict the internet will still host the same remnants of today’s internet. You would still be able to make a quick internet search, use websites, make transactions—I doubt this feature would ever go away—and the design of the internet would have changed or evolved with the inclusion of new emergent spaces or features. Once more, I predict there will be new features that change the way we both visually look at our screens and interact with them. I do apologize; for the most part my predictions have been pretty general, yet one thing is for certain: the internet will change and expand its capabilities in ways we haven’t seen before or even now. Will it be too much? Is its expansion inevitable? Or will it all collapse? These are the intrusive questions that come with thinking about a future that is still unknown and not guaranteed. 
             </p>

             <p>
                Aside from my worry about the state of the world and the subsequent access to the internet in this future time. I can theorize that the web will continue to expand its use of AI, and therefore AI will have become widespread. AI will be so fully ingrained that our future society will forget how the internet used to work prior to its introduction. We’d be able to speak directly with an AI chatbot, our computer parts would be made with AI programmed in them, and AI would know who you are as a user. Let me paint the picture for you: You load up whatever web browser is still running at this time—my money's on Google, but anyway. You go to make a search. Then about ¼ of your screen has an AI avatar staring and waiting for you to type out your wondering or inquiry into the search box. Since it is a humanoid avatar taking part of your screen, the AI’s eyes glance away from you and towards the search box where you are typing. Before you even finish your sentence, the AI has already queued up some potential answers to your not-yet-formulated question. You do have the option to disable this AI feature in your settings, but to get to it would take some research and investigating because nothing can ever be too easy. If my little picture is correct, web developers might push for a way to humanize and characterize AI so they aren't just mere chatbots working behind the scenes. They might become more developed and humanlike. They might act as our helpful built-in computer servants, waiting to get you connected quickly. Honestly, I hope this isn’t the case then, but it doesn’t feel far off. We might even get holograms; the ideas feel sort of endless?
