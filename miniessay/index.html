                <h2> To you,</h2>
                <h3> Nov 19, 2025</h3>
             <p> In about 50-100 years I believe that the future of the internet will look different than it does today. This first prediction is made on the premise that the internet does not uphold the same aesthetics of its initial launch and creation. As you might recall, it took a rather short period of time for the internet to transform its looks. As a result of this, the internet has also developed along the way to function more uniquely, personally, and faster than then. Plainly speaking, the internet you logged into about twenty-five years ago does not resemble the exact aesthetics and functions of that time; it has grown. Thus, on good authority, one can believe the future internet will look and function differently than it does today, especially in fifty to a hundred years from now. I expect it to develop in unprecedented ways that aren’t parallel to today. I’m visualizing rapid responsiveness, tightly secured networks, super personalized algorithms or systems, and areas for connecting with people like never seen before. 

              <p>I admit I’m not the strongest theorist. However, despite this, I predict the internet will still host the same remnants of today’s internet. You would still be able to make a quick internet search, use websites, and make transactions—I doubt this feature would ever go away—and the design of the internet would have changed or evolved with the inclusion of new emergent spaces on the web. Once more, I predict there will be new features that change the way we both visually look at our screens and interact with them. I do apologize; for the most part my predictions have been pretty general, yet one thing is for certain: the internet will change and expand its capabilities. Will it be too much? Is its expansion inevitable? 
              </p> 
                    
                Aside from my worry about the state of the world and access to the internet in the next fifty years or so. I theorize it will continue to expand its use of AI, and therefore AI will have become widespread. AI will be so fully ingrained that future society will forget how the internet used to work prior to its introduction. We’d be able to speak directly with an AI chatbot, our computer parts would be made with AI programmed in them, and AI would know who you are as a user. Let me paint the picture for you: You load up whatever web source is still running at this time—my money's on Google, but anyway— You go to the search in your internet browser. Then about ¼ of your screen has an AI avatar staring and waiting for your input into the search box. When you are formulating your prompt or question, the AI’s eyes glance away from you and towards the search box where you are typing. Before you even finish your sentence, the AI has already queued up some potential answers to your not-yet-formulated question. You do have the option to disable this AI feature in Google. It would require you to go to your settings and disable this ability. If my little picture is correct, developers might push for a way to humanize and characterize AI so they aren't just mere chatbots. They might become more developed.
